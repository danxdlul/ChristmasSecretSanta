 Random gift recipient selector
 
 
FTP address for files are stored as string in code
FTP username/password values are placeholder in code, use your own

This allows you to select your name from a predefined list inside a txt file (contained on an FTP server)

You can type a few gift ideas for the person whose recipient you will be

A button will randomly pick a recipient for you from the list


The following is ensured:

- Without access to the FTP server's user+pass, you cannot view other people's results.
- Your choice is final
- You only receive a gift from 1 other person
- You will not be your own gift's recipient
